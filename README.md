> # Git Branch Naming Conventions
>
> ### Branch Categories:
>
> - _feature_ is for adding, refactoring or removing a feature
> - _bugfix_ is for fixing a bug
> - _hotfix_ is for changing code with a temporary solution and/or without following the usual process (usually because of an emergency)
> - _test_ is for experimenting outside of an issue/ticket
>
> # Git Commit Message Pattern

> ### Commit Categories:

> - _build:_ Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
> - _ci:_ Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
> - _docs:_ Documentation only changes
> - _feat:_ A new feature
> - _fix:_ A bug fix
> - _perf:_ A code change that improves performance
> - _refactor:_ A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
> - _style:_ Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
> - _test:_ Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

> ### Note: The main branch will be called "dev"
>
> - Ensure to pull/update/create your branch from the dev branch before pushing new changes.
> - Always resolve all conflicts after pulling changes from the dev branch.
> - Under no circumstance should anyone make changes to the dev branch.
> - Communicate to the channel when you push new changes, and others are expected to pull.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
